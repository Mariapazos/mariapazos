                "I hate going to the market and leaving empty-handed for not waiting for the endless queue ..."
            <h5>PROBLEM & SOLUTION</h5> 
            <p>It is an E-Commerce that aims to transfer the shopping market experience to a digital environment, as well as the user's confidence in fresh and quality products.</p> 
            <h5>UX RESEARCH</h5> 
            <p>From the surveys and interviews conducted, we obtained the following results:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>- More than 80% of users claim to have left the supermarket without buying, because they did not wait for the queue, ever.</li>
                <li>- Loss of time and discomfort about displacement.</li>
                <li>- 73% affirm that the lack of stock in specific days and hours is an impediment when organizing to make the purchase.</li>
                <li>- People who share a home are frustrated with the organization of a shared purchase.</li>
            </ul>
            <div class="col-md-6" style="margin:0% auto">
                    <img src="images/studies.png" alt="" />
            </div>

            <p>Once established certain parameters with the research we generate our User reference person.

            Other tools such as Empathy Map or User Journey helped us to better understand the wishes and needs of the user and set a flow that was finally specified by a card sorting and testing.</p>

                    <img src="images/Emphatymap.png" alt="" />
            </div>
            <h5>FROM UX TO UI</h5> 
            <p>The product has the following attributes:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>- Trust </li>   
                <li>- Transparency</li> 
                <li>- Closeness</li>
                <li>- Reliability</li>       
            </ul>
            
            <p>Through the moodboard we define colors, typography, shapes, illustrations and tone of voice.</p>
            <div class="col-md-6" style="margin:0% auto">
                    <img src="images/Moodabc.png" alt="" />
            </div>
            <p>The logo is born from the main idea of ​​community, union and closeness; being the user the fundamental piece in the interaction.</p>
            <div class="col-md-6" style="margin:0% auto">
                    <img src="images/logoabc.png" alt="" />
            </div>
            <p>we launched a Style Tile collecting shadows, spacing, active and inactive buttons, illustrations and colors, and in this way we were able to visualize the meaning that the product was charging.
            Finally we designed the screens in High Fidelity and managed to animate it with Flinto.</p> 
            <h5>FINAL PRODUCT</h5> 
            <p>A product that allows the user to create shared shopping lists, obtain fresh and quality products, be attended at any time and even manage a purchase by telephone.</p>
