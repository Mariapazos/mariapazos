                "I hate going to the market and leaving empty-handed for not waiting for the endless queue ..."
            <h5>PROBLEM & SOLUTION</h5> 
            <p>It is an E-Commerce that aims to transfer the shopping market experience to a digital environment, as well as the user's confidence in fresh and quality products.</p> 
            <h5>UX RESEARCH</h5> 
            <p>From the surveys and interviews conducted (140 surveys/8 interviews), we obtained the following results:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>- The 80% claim to have left the supermarket without buying, because they did not wait for the queue, ever.</li>
                <li>- Loss of time and discomfort about displacement.</li>
                <li>- The 73% affirm that lack of stock in specific days is an impediment when organizing to make the purchase.</li>
                <li>- People who share a home are frustrated with the organization of a shared purchase.</li>
            </ul>
            <p></p>
            <div class="col-md-6" style="margin:0% auto">
                    <img src="images/studies.png" alt="" />
            </div>
            <p></p>
            <p>We collected a bunch of data from the research that we had to sort and categorize. To "finish" ("iteration is our friend so stages are never closed") the empathize stage we went through brainstorming and affinity diagram in order to generate and organize ideas. During next stage: define and ideate, we generate our <strong>User Reference Person.</strong>

            <p>This reference helps us to know the user's requirements well, understand their needs, empathize and decide how the product will be. User Persona is a fictitious character that is given by the results of qualitative and quantitative previous research. Other tools such as <strong>Empathy Map</strong> or User Journey helped us to better understand the user's needs as well as identify gain and pain points. Through pain points we tried to see design opportunities and possible features. Then we could set a flow that is finally specified by a card sorting and a real user testing.</p>

            <h5>FROM UX TO UI</h5> 
            <p>The product has the following attributes:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>- Trust </li>   
                <li>- Transparency</li> 
                <li>- Closeness</li>
                <li>- Fresh</li>       
            </ul>
            
            <p>Through the moodboard we define colors, typography, shapes, illustrations and tone of voice.</p>
           
            <div class="carousel-item active">
                    <img class="d-block w-100" src="images/abcmockreduce.png" alt="First slide">
            </div>
            <p>We launched a Style Tile collecting shadows, spacing, active and inactive buttons, illustrations and colors, and in this way we were able to visualize the meaning that the product was charging.
            Finally we designed the screens in High Fidelity and managed to animate it with Flinto.</p> 
            <h5>FINAL PRODUCT</h5> 
            <p>A product that allows the user to create shared shopping lists, obtain fresh and quality products, be attended at any time and even manage a purchase by telephone.</p>
