         <p>With this date came my first ideas to face the final project of Ironhack School.</p>
        <h5>RESEARCH</h5>
        <p>I launched surveys and interviewed several users to obtain information about <strong>adoptions</strong> What
            problems did they find when adopting? What they needed?â€¦

           I faced the following problems:

            <ul>
                <li>- Users think that there is <strong>limited information </strong>about adoption procedures on the
                    websites of animal shelters.</li>
                <li>- Users <strong>waste a lot of time</strong> and find it <strong>cumbersome</strong> navigating
                    different shelter websites.</li>
                <li>- Online adoptions is a really cold process, users <strong>need to have close relationships</strong>
                    with animal shelters.</li>
                <li>- 87% want to <strong>be advised to find an animal related to their lifestyle.</strong></li>
            </ul>
            <p>On the other hand, animal shelters confirmed the problem of knowing the user better before validating
                the adoption to ensure that they choose related lifestyle dogs and that no further returns occur.</p>
        </p>
        <h5>GOAL</h5>
        <p>To increase the number of pet adoptions and solving the user problems detected in the research. <strong>How? through
                a platform where user can find animals of different pet shelters at a glance.</strong></p>
                <div class="project-media row">
                        <div id="lionslider" class="carousel slide" data-ride="carousel">
                            <div class="carousel-inner">
                                <div class="carousel-item active">
                                    <img class="d-block w-100" src="images/ruta.jpg" alt="First slide">
                                </div>
                            </div>
                        </div>
                </div>       
        <h5>FOCUS ON USER</h5>
        <p>First I made a Competitive Analysis and confirmed the nonexistence of similar products. In addition, the
            shelter websites lack clear information about procedures and the hierarchy of information is not optimally
            available.
            Tools like Lean UX Canvas helped me to organize the concepts and start shaping all the information.</p>
        <p><em>User Persona</em> </p>
        <div class="project-media row">
                <div id="lionslider" class="carousel slide" data-ride="carousel">
                    <div class="carousel-inner">
                        <div class="carousel-item active">
                            <img class="d-block w-100" src="images/personaal.jpg" alt="First slide">
                        </div>
                    </div>
                </div>
        </div>
        <p>Tools like Emphaty Map helped me get closer to the user and know what he thinks, hears, says and sees. This
            way I was getting closer and closer to building the right product for the user.</p>
        <p><em>User Journey</em> </p>
        <p>It is about tracing the path that user follows when interacting with the product, reflecting his emotional state in each step.</p>
        <p>Previous:</p>

        <div class="project-media row">
                <div id="lionslider" class="carousel slide" data-ride="carousel">
                    <div class="carousel-inner">
                        <div class="carousel-item active">
                            <img class="d-block w-100" src="images/ujpreval.jpg" alt="First slide">
                        </div>
                    </div>
                </div>
        </div>
        <p>Through this tool came user flow in addition to identifying pain / gain points and setting some goals to
            face them. <strong>Previous User journey</strong> shows the actual user flow identifying pain points; however, the <strong>Future User journey</strong> tries to re-imagine what the new user - product interaction would be like by reflecting the improved pain points, some now converted into gain points and others that will help identify design opportunities. </p>
            <p>Future:</p>
            <div class="project-media row">
                    <div id="lionslider" class="carousel slide" data-ride="carousel">
                        <div class="carousel-inner">
                            <div class="carousel-item active">
                                <img class="d-block w-100" src="images/ujfuturoal.jpg" alt="First slide">
                            </div>
                        </div>
                    </div>
            </div>
        <p>Affinity diagram helped me identify design opportunities. Through Moscow and Complexity Value I studied
            which features were business view viable and discarded those that were not. Card sorting and testing low
            fidelity finally defined the flow.</p>
        <h5>FROM UX TO UI</h5>
    
        <p>It is a product that reflects transparency, how? offering information of any process and giving to user the
            control of their actions; professional, without ceasing to be close since we talk about such an important
            decision that could change the user's life but at the same time warm, close and trusting since we deal with
            animals.

            <p>This is how moodboard emerges and determines part of the style like colors, shapes, illustration or texture.</p> 
            <div class="project-media row">
                    <div id="lionslider" class="carousel slide" data-ride="carousel">
                        <div class="carousel-inner">
                            <div class="carousel-item active">
                                <img class="d-block w-100" src="images/moodboardal.jpg" alt="First slide">
                            </div>
                        </div>
                    </div>
            </div>
            <p></p>
            The <strong>typography</strong> chosen is Imperator. Serifa to achieve readability and offer strength since the product
            contains cards with a lot of information.</p>
            <h5>FINAL PRODUCT</h5>
        <p>Finally here is the online adoption flow with a <strong>prototype video</strong></p>
