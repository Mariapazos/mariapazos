        <p class="project-description">"Animals in need are the best breed"</p>
        <p>More than 138,000 animals were abandoned in 2017 - Affinity Foundation.
            This is the reality ... With these data came my first ideas to face the final project of Ironhack Madrid.</p>
        <h5>RESEARCH</h5>
        <p>I launched surveys and interviewed several users to obtain information about <strong>adoptions</strong> What
            problems did they find when adopting? How did you make sure you found related animals? What they needed?â€¦

            I got interesting results. I faced the following problems:

            <ul>
                <li>- Users think that there is <strong>limited information </strong>about adoption procedures on the
                    websites of animal shelters.</li>
                <li>- Users <strong>waste a lot of time</strong> and find it <strong>cumbersome</strong> navigating
                    different shelter websites.</li>
                <li>- Online adoptions is a really cold process, users <strong>need to have close relationships</strong>
                    with animal shelters.</li>
                <li>- 87% want to <strong>be advised to find an animal related to their lifestyle.</strong></li>
            </ul>
            <p>On the other hand, animal shelters confirmed the problem of knowing the user better before validating
                the adoption to ensure that they choose related lifestyle dogs and that no further returns occur.</p>
        </p>
        <h5>GOAL</h5>
        <p>To increase the number of pet adoptions and solving the user problems detected in the research. How? through
            a platform where user can find animals of different pet shelters at a glance.</p>
        <h5>FOCUS ON USER</h5>
        <p>First I made a Competitive Analysis and confirmed the nonexistence of similar products. In addition, the
            shelter websites lack clear information about procedures and the hierarchy of information is not optimally
            available.
            Tools like Lean UX Canvas helped me to organize the concepts and start shaping all the information.</p>
        <p><em>User Persona</em> </p>
        <div class="col-md-6" style="margin:0% auto">
            <img src="images/UserPersona.png" alt="" />
        </div>
        <p>Tools like Emphaty Map helped me get closer to the user and know what he thinks, hears, says and sees. This
            way I was getting closer and closer to building the right product for the user.</p>
        <p><em>User Journey</em> </p>
        <p>Through this tool came user flow in addition to identifying pain / gain points and setting some goals to
            face them.</p>
        <div class="col-md-6" style="margin:0% auto">
            <img src="images/User journey futuro.png" alt="" />
        </div>
        <p>Affinity diagram helped me identify design opportunities. Through Moscow and Complexity Value I studied
            which features were business view viable and discarded those that were not. Card sorting and testing low
            fidelity finally defined the flow.</p>
        <h5>FROM UX TO UI</h5>
        <p><em>Moodboard</em> </p>
        <div class="carousel-item active">
            <img class="d-block w-100" src="images/Moodboardan.png" alt="First slide">
        </div>
        <p>It is a product that reflects transparency, how? offering information of any process and giving to user the
            control of their actions; professional, without ceasing to be close since we talk about such an important
            decision that could change the user's life but at the same time warm, close and trusting since we deal with
            animals.

            So this is how this moodboard emerges and determines colors, shapes, tone, illustration, texture and
            typography.

            The typography chosen is Imperator. Serifa to achieve readability and offer strength since the product
            contains cards with a lot of information.</p>
        <p>Finally here is the online adoption flow with a <strong>prototype video</strong></p>

        <!-- <div class="project-media">

        <video controls width="100%" height="auto">
                <source src="./images/animalLook.mp4" type="video/mp4">

    </div>

    <script>
        $('#close-project').on('click', function () {
            $('.content-blocks.pop').removeClass('showx');
            $('.inline-menu-container').addClass('showx');
            $('.content-blocks.pop section').empty();
        });
