        <h5> Problem & Solution</h5> 
        <p>The problem is that such an advanced sport is <strong>not digitized at all</strong> . Athletes keep scoring their marks on paper or in the "Leaderboard" but this whole process involves frustrating situations for them.</p> 
        <p>The proposal is a product that allows the user to keep a record of their workouts, weight control and mobility testing. This way the current frustrations that they face dissappear. </p>
        <h5> UX Research</h5> 
        <p>23 tools helped me to organize and focus the study on the user. The results of surveys and interviews are:</p>
        <div class="project-media row">
            <div class="col-md-6" style="margin:0% auto">
                <img src="images/Research_data.png" alt="" />
            </div>
        </div>
            <p>The data reflects the user's need to know their <strong>mobility status</strong>  and how to improve it, to control their <strong> personal training marks </strong>and the chance to obtain an <strong> adapted program </strong>in order to improve performance. First of all I organized data through Blueprint and Lean Ux Canvas. After the research and to better understand user's need I used tools like Emphaty map or User Journey. Finally User Persona was my guide during the process.</p>
            <h5> User Interface</h5>
            <p>It consists of translating the concepts obtained in the research into a visual and tangible product with the aim of guaranteeing that it has elements of easy access, understanding and use. For this, I combined three fundamental pillars; <strong> design, interaction and information architecture.</strong></p>
            <div class="col-md-6" style="margin:0% auto">
                <img src="images/Moodboard.png" alt="" />
            </div>
            <p>The <strong> Moodboard </strong> is an exploratory research tool very useful for the generation of ideas. Through the attributes of the product I relied on the moodboard representing color, shape, texture, tone and illustration.</p>
            <h5> Final Product</h5>
            <p>High Fidelity Wireframes. </p>
